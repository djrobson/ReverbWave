# JUCE Integration Notes

## Project Evolution

### JUCE-Based Approach

The project initially aimed to create a professional audio plugin using the JUCE framework:
- Designed a custom GUI with professional appearance
- Implemented a visual organization of parameters
- Created a preset selector with carefully designed reverb types
- Developed custom look and feel for UI components
   ```

## Future Possibilities for JUCE Integration

While we've moved away from JUCE for now, future possibilities include:

1. **Optional JUCE GUI**:
   - Implementing a separate JUCE-based GUI that connects to the core engine
   - This would be an optional component, not required for core functionality

2. **Plugin Wrapper**:
   - Creating a thin JUCE wrapper to expose the engine as a VST/AU plugin
   - Would require addressing the dependency issues

3. **Alternative Frameworks**:
   - Exploring lighter GUI frameworks like IMGUI or SDL
   - These could provide graphical interfaces with fewer dependencies
