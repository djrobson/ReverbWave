# SimpleReverb Project Summary

## Project Overview
This project implements a feature-rich audio reverb effect with multiple implementations:

1. A standalone C++ processor for WAV files with real-time spectrum analysis and fluid wave animations
2. A terminal-based GUI for controlling reverb parameters
3. A VST3 plugin version compatible with digital audio workstations (DAWs)

## Components

### SimpleReverb (Standalone Application)
- Processes WAV files with configurable reverb parameters
- Features real-time spectrum analysis with fluid wave animations
- Includes terminal visualization for frequency spectrum
- Supports different animation modes and color schemes
- Cross-platform compatible (Linux and Windows)

### ReverbGUI (Interactive Controls)
- Text-based user interface for controlling reverb parameters
- Allows parameter visualization with simple sliders
- Includes preset management for quick effect selection
- Parameters include:
  - Room Size (0.0 to 1.0)
  - Damping (0.0 to 1.0)
  - Wet Level (0.0 to 1.0)
  - Dry Level (0.0 to 1.0)
  - Width (0.0 to 1.0)
  - Freeze Mode (0.0 to 1.0)
  - High Frequency Delay (0.0 to 1.0)
  - Crossover (0.0 to 1.0)
  - Harmonic Detuning Amount (0.0 to 1.0)

### ReverbVST (Plugin Version)
- Complete VST3 plugin using the JUCE framework
- Integrates the reverb algorithm into a professional plugin format
- Includes spectrum analysis visualization
- Compatible with all major DAWs supporting VST3

## Reverb Algorithm Features
- Combines comb and allpass filters for natural reverb sound
- Separate high and low frequency processing paths
- Adjustable crossover frequency
- Variable high-frequency delay for greater sound depth
- Stereo width control for spatial enhancement
- Harmonic detuning for enhanced stereo image and tonal complexity
- Freeze mode for infinite reverb tails

## Spectrum Analyzer Features
- Real-time FFT-based frequency analysis
- Multiple visualization modes (Wave, Bars)
- Multiple color schemes
- Fluid animations for dynamic visual feedback
- Logarithmic frequency scale (20Hz to 20kHz)

## Project Architecture
- Core reverb algorithm implemented in C++ (SimpleReverb class)
- Modularity through clear class separation:
  - SimpleReverb: Core algorithm
  - SimpleAudioProcessor: Processing chain and integration
  - SpectrumAnalyzer: Audio analysis and visualization
  - ReverbGUI: User interface
- JUCE integration for plugin functionality

## Build Information
- CMake-based build system for cross-platform compatibility
- Multiple executable targets:
  - SimpleReverb (standalone processor)
  - ReverbGUI (terminal UI)
  - IntegrationDemo (showcase integration)
  - ReverbVST (VST3 plugin)
- Support for Linux and Windows platforms

## Usage Instructions
- **SimpleReverb**: Process WAV files and visualize frequency spectrum
- **ReverbGUI**: Control reverb parameters through text interface
- **ReverbVST**: Use as a plugin in compatible DAWs
  - Copy the VST3 plugin from `./build/ReverbVST_artefacts/Release/`
  - Place in your DAW's plugin directory
